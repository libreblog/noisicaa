This directory contains some stub files for 3rdparty modules, which don't have any.

- sip.pyi

Copied from the .deb package, which isn't in the search path from the virtual env.

- PyQt5/*.pyi

The PyQt5 package, when installed with pip, does not include the stub files, which
are created when building PyQt5 from source. These files are just copied from a manual
build.
Also tweaked the files a bit, because they don't work with mypy as is...

- posix_ipc.pyi

Manually crafted, with just the subset of class that I actually use (i.e. incomplete).
