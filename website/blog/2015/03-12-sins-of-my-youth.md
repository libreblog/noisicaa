Title: Sins of my Youth
Date: 2015-12-03

I mentioned the [Deluxe Music Construction
Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Music_Construction_Set) before. I used that mostly to
transcribe sheet music, which I found in the public library. Some classical pieces,
e.g. https://youtu.be/UqOOZux5sPE - because that movie is awesome, and if I remember correctly some
of the older Genesis songs. I can't remember if I actually tried to write my own music with it -
whatever files I saved back then are gone forever.

But I also played around with "trackers" - I think it was mostly
[NoiseTracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoiseTracker) and
[OctaMED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OctaMED). And strangely enough, even after ~25 years I still
have those files sitting on my harddisk. And there's even software that can play them back or
convert them to slightly more modern formats.

Just for the giggles, I uploaded some of those to
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/odahoda/sets/sins-of-my-youth):

I can't claim that my artistic skills have changed, let alone improved, in the meantime.

But I'm probably a better coder now.
