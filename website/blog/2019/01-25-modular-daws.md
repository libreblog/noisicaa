Title: Modular DAWs
Date: 2019-01-25

I recently came across those two announcements:

* [Loomer Architect: A modular MIDI
  toolkit](https://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=517104) (via
  [LinuxMusicians](https://linuxmusicians.com/))
* [Bitwig Studio is about to deliver on a fully modular core in a
  DAW](http://cdm.link/2019/01/bitwig-studio-3-modular/) (via
  [planet.linuxaudio.org](http://planet.linuxaudio.org/))

I only read those articles and looked at the pretty pictures, but haven't tried out any of
those. But judging from that superficial glance, both these projects seem to move into the same
direction as noisicaä. The Bitwig article also lists some more software with a similar approach. So
it appears that my idea for a modular DAW isn't that unique, possibly rather old, and perhaps some
recent trend thing (the last two aren't necessarily a contradiction).

I'm trying to pay not too much attention to other audio software, which includes *not* trying that
stuff out myself. This is partly to keep myself in blissfully ignorant that what I'm doing has
already been done before (and probably better), i.e. a waste of time. But also to keep a fresh
perspective and possibly create something new, instead of just cloning what already exist - assuming
that I actually have any new ideas, which is doubtful. And finally, if I'd get too much inspiration
from other projects, I would just end up with an unmanageable pile of ideas of all those great
things I should add to noisicaä, and would never get done. But I do keep a list of bookmarks of
stuff that I find along the way, including related or similar software projects.
